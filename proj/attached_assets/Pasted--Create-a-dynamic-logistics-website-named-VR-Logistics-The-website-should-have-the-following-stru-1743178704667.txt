    Navigation Bar:

        Home

        Products

        Contact Us

Each navigation option should lead to a separate file that contains its content:

    Home: A welcoming page with a logistic-related background (such as a warehouse, trucks, or a map) that gives a professional feel. Include a logo for 'VR Logistics' at the top.

    Products: A page listing five logistics-related products with attractive images and descriptions. The products are:

        Oil (with image of oil container or related product)

        Coffee Powder (image of coffee powder packaging)

        Tea Powder (image of tea powder packaging)

        Arecanut (image of arecanut)

        Spices (image of different spices, like red chili powder, turmeric, etc.)

    About: A short description of the logistics business, its mission, and the services it offers.

    Contact Us: A page with contact details like phone, email, and an embedded Google Map for location.

    Logo: A professional and simple logo for VR Logistics should appear on all pages at the top, next to the navigation bar.

    Design Requirements:

        The website should be visually appealing with a modern and clean design.

        Use a color palette that is professional and clean, possibly with shades of blue, white, and gray.

        Responsive design: the website should be mobile-friendly.

        Use attractive typography and good spacing to make the content easy to read and navigate.

        Include product photos with appropriate descriptions for each product in the Products section.

    Functionality:

        Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the pages and interactivity.

        Make sure that the website is fully responsive for different screen sizes.

    File Structure:

        Create separate files for each of the following:

            home.html

            products.html

            about.html

            contact.html

            styles.css for styling the pages

            scripts.js for any dynamic elements, such as navigation hover effects or smooth scrolling.

Ensure that the design is attractive and professional, and the navigation between pages is smooth and user-friendly. Provide appropriate code for all the components, including any JavaScript required for interactivity."
